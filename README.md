# mnist-rbf-svm
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Support Vector Machine (SVM) for categorizing the MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately classify the 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) in the MNIST dataset without employing neural networks or deep learning techniques.
