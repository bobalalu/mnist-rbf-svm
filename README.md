# Task: MNIST Dataset Classification using RBF-SVM

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Support Vector Machine (SVM) for categorizing the MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately classify the 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) in the MNIST dataset without employing neural networks or deep learning techniques.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following Python packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bobalalu/mnist-rbf-svm.git
   cd mnist-rbf-svm
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook:**
   Navigate to the `mnist_rbf_svm.ipynb` file and open it.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the RBF-SVM model, and evaluate its performance.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Loading the Dataset:**

   - The MNIST dataset is loaded using Scikit-learn's `fetch_openml` function.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
   - The pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].

3. **Model Training:**

   - An RBF-SVM model is initialized using Scikit-learn's `SVC` class with the `kernel='rbf'` parameter.
   - The model is trained on the training dataset.
   - The model is tested on the testing dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation:**

   - The trained model is used to make predictions on the test dataset.
   - The accuracy of the model is calculated and displayed.
   - A confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the classification results for the training and testing datasets.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):**

   - Grid search is performed to find the best hyperparameters (`C` and `gamma`) for the RBF-SVM model.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Some sample images from the test set are displayed along with their predicted labels.

## Results

After running the notebook, you should see the following outputs:

- **Accuracy:** The accuracy of the RBF-SVM model on the test set.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A visual representation of the model's performance across different classes.
- **Sample Predictions:** A few sample images from the test set along with their predicted labels.
